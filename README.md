NumPy, which stands for Numerical Python, is a library consisting of multidimensional array objects and a collection of routines for processing those arrays. Using NumPy, mathematical and logical operations on arrays can be performed. This document explains the basics of NumPy such as its nd-arrays manipulation. It also discusses the various array functions, array broadcastings, types of indexing and slicing.
